I developed this hamburger webpage for my web portfolio by following a detailed tutorial on YouTube.
I began by learning the basics of HTML to structure the page, then used CSS to design it stylishly,
and finally implemented JavaScript to add interactive functionalities.
I was motivated by the challenge of applying what I learned and turning it into a unique and personalized creation.
Each step of the tutorial brought me closer to my goal of creating a dynamic and appealing webpage that I could showcase in my portfolio as a testament to my web development skills
